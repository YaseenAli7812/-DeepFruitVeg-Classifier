# 🍏🍅 Fruit & Vegetable Classifier

A deep learning model to classify different **fruits and vegetables** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and **Transfer Learning**.

## 🔍 Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize and classify images of **fruits and vegetables**. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, employing transfer learning with **pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG16, or MobileNet** for improved accuracy.

## ✨ Features
- Multi-class classification of fruits and vegetables.
- Uses **Transfer Learning** to improve performance.
- Supports real-time image prediction.
- Data augmentation to enhance model generalization.
- Achieves high accuracy in classifying different food items.

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used
- **Python** (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV)
- **Deep Learning** (CNNs, Transfer Learning)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## ⚙️ Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Fruit-Vegetable-Classifier.git
   cd Fruit-Vegetable-Classifier
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download or Prepare Dataset**
   - You can use a dataset like **Fruits-360** or a custom dataset.
   - Place images inside the `data/` folder.

## 💡 Usage
1. **Run the Model Training Script**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
2. **Make Predictions on a New Image**
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
   import tensorflow as tf
   from PIL import Image
   import numpy as np

   # Load model
   model = load_model("fruit_veg_model.h5")

   # Load and preprocess image
   image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
   img = tf.keras.utils.load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
   img_array = tf.keras.utils.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
   img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

   # Make prediction
   prediction = model.predict(img_array)
   print("Predicted Class:", prediction.argmax())
   ```

## 🔎 Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** using transfer learning.
- Reduced training time and improved model efficiency.

## 📝 To-Do List
- [ ] Improve model performance with hyperparameter tuning.
